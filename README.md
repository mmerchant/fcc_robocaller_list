# Data on Unwanted Calls

This script simply fetches the spreadsheet from the FCC's site (https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/205239443-Data-on-Unwanted-Calls)
and outputs only the telephone numbers.

Quick and dirty script here written so that if you wanted to add additional functionality you could (e.g. wrap each TN with regex pattern matching)
or perform a db insert.

Have fun!
